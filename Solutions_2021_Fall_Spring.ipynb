    "Download all files attached to this exam and place them in the same directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your solutions must be given in the notebook's answer cells marked with \"ANSWER CELL\" on the first line. Do not remove these markings. If you are asked to implement a Python function, do not change the function name or its parameters that are already filled out in the cell.** You are allowed to add additional cells if you have need for them but you are not allowed to remove any cells you have not added yourself.\n",

    "The assignments are divided into three sections:\n",
    "1. Python programming (4 assignments, 8 points + possibility for 1 bonus point)\n",

It might sound surprising that even in a small group with $n=23$ people, the probability is over 50%. With $n=70$ people, the probability is close to 99.9%.

    "The CSV file `daily_tv_viewing_time.csv` contains the average daily viewing time in minutes for Norwegian TV channels for each of the last three years (2018, 2019 and 2020). The data for each year is broken down by age groups:\n",

    "- `AgeGroup`: the age group, as described above (the word \"years\" is omitted from the values).\n",
    "- Remaining columns: average daily viewing time in minutes for individual TV channels identified by the column name (e.g. `NRK1`). The last column (`Others`) is not related to a specific channel but summarizes the time spent watching other TV channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four big media groups in Norway: *NRK*, *TV 2*, *Discovery* and *NENT*. The CSV file `media_groups.csv` contains an overview of what channels are owned by each of these groups. Note that some channels are owned by smaller media groups and **not** included in the overview.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Each task must be solved programmatically, i.e. you need to write Python code that uses the data files and calculates an answer. You are not allowed to change the contents of the data files.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tips:\n",
    "- First inspect the content of both files. Then read all assignments in this section, and think about what operations you should do with the data before solving the assignments (e.g. how to merge the data, what to use as the index, you might want to add some columns and/or sort the data in a particular order, etc.)\n",
